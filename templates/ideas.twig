    <h2 class="headline--beta">Call for Papers Talk Ideas</h2>
    <p>
        {{ site.title }} is not limited to just PHP-related talks. There have been
        sessions covering a wide range of topics supporting PHP developers and DevOps
        as well, and we encourage you to "think outside the box" to come up with your
        own unique topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Neither are we focused on any particular niche and thus welcome submissions from
        all categories of PHP development and supporting technologies. If you are working
        with native PHP, WordPress, Drupal, or any of the many frameworks available, you
        could have a great subject to share.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to financial constraints most conferences tend to pick speakers to present
        multiple talks. Therefore <strong>it is advisable to submit a few talk ideas, not just one.</strong>
        By submitting a single talk you may lessen your chances of being selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        To get the ideas flowing, here's a few suggestions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Virtualization and environments</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Alternate PHP run-times</li>
        <li>PHP internals</li>
        <li>Development principles</li>
